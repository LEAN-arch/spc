# ðŸ”¬ The Interactive Assay Transfer & Lifecycle Toolkit

Welcome to the definitive interactive guide for mastering the statistical methods essential for a robust assay transfer and lifecycle management plan. This Streamlit application is designed as a professional-grade educational and analytical tool, bridging classical Statistical Process Control (SPC) with modern Machine Learning and AI concepts.

This toolkit transforms abstract statistical theory into tangible, interactive visualizations, framed within a compelling narrative of a scientist's journey to conquer process variation.

## ðŸš€  The Scientist's Journey: A Three-Act Story
The toolkit is structured as a narrative to provide a logical workflow for a typical assay transfer and lifecycle management project.
Act I: Know Thyself (The Foundation)
Before you can control a process, you must understand your tools. This act covers the foundational characterization and validation steps.
1. Gage R&R: Is my measurement system reliable?
2. Linearity and Range: What is the trustworthy operating range of my assay?
3. LOD & LOQ: How sensitive is my assay?
4. Method Comparison: How does my new method compare to the old one?
5. Assay Robustness (DOE/RSM): Where are the hidden weaknesses in my assay's procedure?
Act II: The Transfer (The Crucible)
The validated method is now put to the test in a new environment. This is the core of the transfer, focusing on stability and capability.
6. Process Stability (Shewhart): Is the process stable and predictable in the new lab?
7. Small Shift Detection (EWMA/CUSUM): Can I detect subtle, slow degradation over time?
8. Run Validation (SPC Rules): How do I make objective pass/fail decisions every day?
9. Process Capability (Cpk): Is my stable process actually capable of meeting specifications?
Act III: The Guardian (Beyond the Transfer)
The assay is live. Now, the focus shifts to advanced, long-term monitoring and proactive management.
10. Anomaly Detection (ML): Can I find "unknown unknowns" or novel failure modes?
11. Predictive QC (ML): Can I predict a run failure before it happens?
12. Control Forecasting (AI): Where is my process heading in the next month?
13. Pass/Fail Analysis (Wilson Score): How do I reliably validate my qualitative assays?
14. Bayesian Inference: How can I leverage historical knowledge to be more efficient?
15. Confidence Interval Concept: A foundational lesson on understanding statistical uncertainty.
